# Real-Final-Project

This is the Final Project for EPI590R saved as a .qmd file.

Please open the file and render to see output. Alternatively, you can also run the codes in each chunks within the .qmd file or run the R script.

For the "reciprocal function", you can input the Odds Ratio shown in Table 2 and Table 3, for the variable "Sex" and "Ticket Class", to get the reciprocal Odds Ratio.

For the "proportion function", you can replace the the variable from (titanic_data\$Sex == "female") to ("titanic_data\$Sex =="male"), it should give you the value that correspond with the counts provided in the Table 1 i.e., N female / total passengers or N male / total passengers.

[Comments:]{.underline}

There are a lot of functions out there and one of the key take away there is a need to make sure that the correct set of codes are used to generate the results for the various statistical analysis i.e., using log regression for binary outcome, and linear regression for continuous dependent variable.

I think there is a lot more room for manipulation of data output in R than SAS, and definitely more online support from many users, and multiple ways to get a specific outcome we want to achieve.
