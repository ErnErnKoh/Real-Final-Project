# Real-Final-Project

This is the Final Project for EPI590R saved as a .qmd file. Please open the file and render to see the output. Alternatively, you can also run the codes in each chunks within the .qmd file on R.

There are a lot of functions out there and one of the key take away there is a need to make sure that the correct set of codes are used to generate the results for the various statistical analysis i.e., using log regression for binary outcome, and linear regression for continuous dependent variable.

I think there is a lot more room for manipulation of data output in R than SAS, and definitely more online support from many users, and multiple ways to get a specific outcome we want to achieve.
