There are a lot of functions out there and one of the key take away there is a need to make sure that the correct set of codes are used to generate the results for the various statistical analysis i.e., using log regression for binary outcome, and linear regression for continuous dependent variable.

I think there is a lot more room for manipulation of data output in R than SAS, and definitely more online support from many users, and multiple ways to get a specific outcome we want to achieve.
